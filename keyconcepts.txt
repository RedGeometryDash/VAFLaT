Rules: 
- No repeating what rules that were discussed in previous lessons for example: if it's a lesson after one where the -ation rule was discussed then we dont write any new -ation words the teacher teaches us, since the questions can be answered without that key memorization.
- All key points are in order to as they were discussed in the audio.
Lesson 2 Key concept: English and Spanish share some similarities—certain types of English words convert over to Spanish. All or most words in English ending in -al convert over to Spanish.
Lesson 3 Key concept: As mentioned previously, English and Spanish have even more convertable words. Most words in English ending in -ant or -ent are the same in Spanish but with an added e. For example: important -> importante. -Mente is also the equivalent to -ly in English; constantly -> constantemente. Words ending in -ible and -able are also usually the same in Spanish.
Lesson 4 Key concept: "I want" in Spanish is "quiero." Words ending in -ion are the same in English in Spanish. Words ending in -tion turn into -ción (note: not all -tion words convert, but most -ation words do). Most or all -ación words can also convert to verbs,  to do this simply replace the -ación with -ar to get an unconjugated verb, for example: Concentration -> Concentración -> Concentrar, this final word means "to concentrate." To say "me" in Spainish, you simply say "mi," to say "myself" it''s "me."
Lesson 5 Key concept: The pronoun for "I" in Spanish is "Yo," it's usually only used for emphasis. "It" in Spanish is "lo" or "la."
Lesson 6 Key concept: Intento in Spanish is "I try" or "I'm trying." Voy in Spanish is "I go" or I'm going." Everything else was reviewed previously.
Lesson 7 Key concept: "Demonstration" in Spanish is "demostración," there is no "n" in this word after converting. If you remove the "de" in "demostrar" you get "mostrar" which means "to show." The word for "something" is "algo." Verbs that describe movement connect to unconjugated verbs and places with the letter "a," for example: "I'm going to continue" is "voy a continuar" and not "voy continuar." "Lo" in Spanish means "it" or "him," but "los" in Spanish means it pural, which means "los" in English is "them." "To pass" in Spanish is "pasar."
Lesson 8 Key concept: "La" in Spanish means "her" or "it" for a feminine word. You could use "lo" and "la" as "you" formally. "Quiere means" "he/she/it wants" but also it can mean "you want" formally. "Why" in Spanish is "por qué," another very similar word; "porque" is "because" in English. "To come" in Spanish is "venir." "The house" in Spanish is "la casa." "Debo" in Spanish means "I owe" or "I must."
Lesson 9 Key concept: "To know" in Spanish is "saber." "Yes" in Spanish is "sí," but can also be "if" in Spanish is "si" doesn't have an accent. "To explain" in Spanish is "explicar," the -ation form in english is "explanation" but it converts to "explicación," not "explanación." "You" informally is "te."
Lesson 10 Key concept: All unconjugated verbs in Spanish end in -r and belong to one of three groups: -ar, -er, or -ir. To make the “I” form of a verb, remove -ar, -er, or -ir and add -o. For example, "intentar" becomes "intento." "To eat" is "comer." "Late" in Spanish is "tarde." "Tomorrow" is "mañana." You can use the present tense in Spanish to talk about the future if a future word like "mañana" is present, for example: "I eat tomorrow" is "como mañana." "With" in Spanish is "con." "To have" in Spanish is "tener." "Later" is "más tarde." "To contain" is "contener." "To obtain" is "obtener." "To sustain" is "sostener." "To maintain" is "mantener." "To entertain" is "entretener." -Tain turns into -tener. "Between" in Spanish is "entre." "I have" is "tengo" and not "teno" "I come" is "vengo" not "veno"
Lesson 11 Key concept: -ar verbs conjugated for "he/she" or "el/ella" turns into -a, for example: "he eliminates" is "el elimina" (this also means "you eliminate" formally). "A lot" in Spanish is "mucho." "To last" in Spanish is "durar." "To chew" in Spanish is "masticar." -ar verbs conjugated for "they/you all" or "ellos/ellas/ustedes" turn into -an, for example: "they eliminate" is "ellos eliminan." "Hablar" means "to speak." -ar verbs conjugated for "you" or "tu" turn into -as, for example: "you eliminate" is "tu eliminas." Te, me, lo, la, los and las can't go right after a conjugated verb, instead they go infront, but they can go right after an unconjugated verb.
Lesson 12 Key concept: -er verbs conjugated for "he/she" or "el/ella" turns into -e, for example: "he sells" is "el vende," for "they" the ending is -en. Words ending in -ity in English end in -idad in Spanish, you can intuitively find out Spanish words through this conversion, for example: personality -> personalidad -> person -> persona. When refering to a person their pronoun goes before the object, for example; "they sell me it" is "me lo venden." "Us" in Spanish is "nos."
Lesson 13 Key concept: "To do" or "to make" in Spanish is "hacer." "Puedo" in Spanish means "I can." "Llegar" means "to arrive." Some verbs are irregular, meaning their stem changes when conjugated, for example: "to leave" is "salir" but "I leave" is "salgo." "Esperar" means "to wait" and "to hope." -ary words in English turn into -ario words in Spanish.
Lesson 14 Key concept: "To know" in Spanish is "saber," "I know" in Spanish is "yo sé," saber conjugated for yo is irregular but all other conjugations are regular. "What" in Spanish is "qué." The word for "he" is "él." The word for "she" is "élla." To say "but he/she does" in Spanish you say "pero el/ella sí." "Salir" conjugated for yo is also irregular, it turns into "salgo," every other conjugation is regular. "Tener" + "qué" makes "to have to," so "tengo qué" is "I have to." "Tiene" means he has, "tener" changes its stem when conjugated for he/she/it, they, and you (informal), "venir" does the same thing, "viene" means "he/she/it comes." "When" in Spanish is "cuando." Many verbs that end in -ner are conguated to -ngo for yo, for example: "obtener" -> "obtengo." "Poner" means "to put." Verbs in English ending in -pose turn into -poner in Spanish, for example: "compose" -> "componer."
Lesson 15 Key concept: "Pasar" means "to pass" but it also means "to happen," so "qué pasa" means "what's happening." When we have a verb with an "e" in its stem (the part before the ending) and the "e" is (usually but not always) stressed in the conjugated version of the verb, then it splits to "ie" (remember the penultimate syllable is usually stressed), this rule also appies to some nouns. "Pensar" can also mean "to plan" in certain contexts. "Entender" means "to understand." "Perder" means "to lose."
Lesson 16 Key concept: "Empezar" means "to start" in English. Sometimes when the the penultimate syllable of a conjugated verb or a noun is "e," it splits into "ue." "New" in Spanish is "nuevo." "Population" should be "populación" but instead its "población." "Dormir" means "to sleep," and to say "I'm falling asleep" you can say "me duermo." "Encontrar" means "to encounter" or "to find." A lot of the time a noun is some variation of its verb form in Spanish, for example: "To encounter" in Spanish is "encontrar" and "an encounter" is "un encuentro."
