Slop project :3

This is a school project I'm making.

This isn't fully coded by me. This is mainly coded with the aid of DeepSite and ChatGPT.

I personally learned Spanish with Language Transfer in a super short amount of time, when I asked my Spanish teacher why he didn't use it to teach, he said it's because it wasn't interactive enough, that's why this exists.

I myself have done NONE of the audio work which is this sites main mechanism of teaching. All credit for the main content of this site go to Mihalis Eleftheriou; the creator of Language Transfer.

If this repo by some miracle motivates you to use Language Transfer to learn Spanish then please consider donating to them. https://www.languagetransfer.org/donations
